# predicting-the-impact-of-selected-bank-stocks-on-nifty-using-deep-learning
Predicting stock market movements, particularly for indices like Bank Nifty, is a challenging task due to the volatile and unpredictable nature of stock prices. This makes it difficult for investors to make informed decisions based on market trends. My project aims to address these challenges by providing a robust solution that helps investors understand the events affecting Bank Nifty and make better investment decisions.
